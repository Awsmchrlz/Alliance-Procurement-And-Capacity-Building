# Alliance Procurement & Capacity Building - Database Schema

## üéØ Overview

This document describes the comprehensive, normalized database schema for the Alliance Procurement & Capacity Building platform. The schema is designed to capture all form data, ensure data consistency, and provide optimal performance.

## üìÅ Schema File

**Single Source of Truth:** `database-schema.sql`

This is the **only** SQL file you need to run. It's idempotent (safe to run multiple times) and contains everything needed for a production-ready database.

## üîí Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with comprehensive policies:

- **Users**: Can view/edit own profile, admins can manage all users
- **Events**: Public read access, admin management
- **Registrations**: Users see own registrations, admins see all
- **Sponsorships**: Public submission, finance admin management
- **Exhibitions**: Public submission, finance admin management
- **Newsletter**: Public subscription, admin management

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Super Admin**: Full system access
- **Finance Person**: Financial operations and approvals
- **Event Manager**: Event management (limited financial access)
- **Ordinary User**: Basic user access

### Storage Security
- **Payment Evidence Bucket**: Secure file storage with proper access controls
- **Authentication Required**: All file operations require valid authentication
- **Admin Override**: Admins can access all evidence files for review

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Comprehensive Indexing
- **Primary Keys**: All tables have UUID primary keys
- **Foreign Keys**: Proper relationships with cascade deletes
- **Search Fields**: Indexed on commonly searched fields (email, phone, company name)
- **Status Fields**: Indexed for filtering (payment_status, status)
- **Date Fields**: Indexed for chronological queries
