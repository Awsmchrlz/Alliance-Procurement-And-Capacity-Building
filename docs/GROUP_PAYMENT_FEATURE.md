  // New group payment fields
  groupSize?: number;
  groupPaymentAmount?: number;
  groupPaymentCurrency?: "ZMW" | "USD";
  organizationReference?: string;
}
```

### **Backend Changes**

```

### **Database Migration**

## 💡 User Experience Enhancements

### **Clear Payment Method Categorization**
```
Individual Payment          Organization Payment
├── Mobile Money           ├── 🏢 Group Payment
├── Bank Transfer          │   └── Pay for multiple people
└── Cash at Event          └── ✅ Already Paid
                               └── My organization paid
```

### **Smart Amount Calculation**
- Automatically calculates total based on group size
- Shows breakdown: "5 × ZMW 7,000 per person = ZMW 35,000"
- Updates in real-time as group size changes

### **Guided Workflow**
- Clear step-by-step instructions for group coordinators
- Helpful hints for team members joining existing group payments
- Validation messages guide users through requirements

## 🔐 Business Logic

### **Payment Status Logic**
- **Group Payment**: `paymentStatus: "pending"`, `hasPaid: false`
- **Organization Paid**: `paymentStatus: "paid"`, `hasPaid: true`
- **Individual Payments**: Existing logic unchanged

### **Verification Process**
1. **Group Coordinator** uploads payment evidence
2. **Finance Team** reviews group payment
3. **Team Members** reference organization/coordinator
4. **System** matches individual registrations to group payment

## 📊 Admin Dashboard Integration
